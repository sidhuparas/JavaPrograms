# JavaPrograms

## Introduction

This repo contains some random programs created by me. It also includes many programs from Javaâ„¢ Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases by Joshua Bloch, Neal Gafter

## Programs List
List mayn't be latest, see actual classes in repo for all the programs:

* Time For A Change (Puzzle)
* Long Division (Puzzle)
* The Last Laugh (Puzzle)
* Automatic Typing (Program to automate Keyboard events)
* Clipboard (Getting and putting contents from and to Clipboard)
* Screen Capture (Takes a screenshot and save it to the FileSystem)
* Task Manager (Lists all the processes running currently)
* Count Prime (Count prime numbers below a given number)
* Heads Or Tails (Toss a coin a number of times and get random result)

## Get Started

It's very easy to get started with the project. Here are the steps:

1. Clone the project and open it in IntelliJ IDEA or any compiler of your choice.
2. As soon as you run it, you will be prompted to enter the class name to run that program.
3. A SWITCH command is used for this purpose. For example, if you type HeadsOrTails, respective program will start.
4. `Main.java` file contains all of this logic and whole project is modular.

Thank you!
